# Travel-and-Trade-Game
Text-based game where the user must to travel to as many countries as possible with the time and money allowed

program was originally designed for a school project and expanded to include more
Skills practiced:
Parent and Child Classes with the parent space and child continents
Linked Lists/Spaces - Every continent points to the continent or nullptr(ocean) north, south, east, and west of it
Stacks - the backpack is a stack where the last thing thrown in the backpack is the first to be pulled out
Array of Passport Stamps - Bool array where when a continent is visited bool becomes true at its corresponding array space


Game Setup:
Well hello, excited traveller.  I hear you want to travel the world?
Well, it is your lucky day.  I am about to give you the trip of a lifetime...
but everything comes with a catch!

I am giving you $3500 and 20 days to complete your travelling adventure.
You win this trip only if you spend my money wisely.
To win, you must travel to all 7 continents within the 20 days.
You earn bonus points for the total number of countries travelled to.
The game is over when you run out of time or money.
BUT, I have no time to waste, so you must start today,
without any visa documents.
So choose which countries you go to wisely, as each country you enter that
requires a visa will kick you out.

I am not completely mean though.  I have given you enough
extra money and a backpack to pick up souvenirs along the way.
Use the souvenirs to barter with visa agents for entry into their country.
Choose your souvenirs wisely as you can only carry so much
and not all souvenirs are equally enticing.

Each day, you can either:
 - spend the day travelling to an adjacent country
 - pay to fly to a different continent
     (only 7 airports exist, one on each continent)
 - spend a day shopping for souvenirs

Are you ready for your adventure?
